Here are two programs for Material Point Method (MPM) simulation. 
Program `MPM` implemented constitutive models for jelly, water, snow and sand. These materials can be coupled naturally.
Program `DFPIC` implemented transfrer schemes of Polynomial Particle-in-cell (PPIC) and Divergenc-free Particle-in-Cell (DFPIC).
